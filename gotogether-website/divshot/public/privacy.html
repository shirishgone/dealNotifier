			<p>
Welcome to gotogether, the online and mobile service of gotogether.mobi.
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
<br> We collect the following types of information about you:
<ul>

	.	<h4>Information you provide us directly: </h4>
		We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, birthdate, phone number, e-mail address, vehicle make, model and year, driver’s license number, automobile registration information, and automobile insurance policy, as well as any information you permit us to collect as part of a background check when you register for a gotogether passenger or driver account, or if you correspond with us. You may also provide us with your financial information for purposes of processing a transaction on or through the Service. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as is further described below.
	.	<h4>Inviting a friend to use gotogether from the “Invite friends”: </h4>
		If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to gotogether through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a SMS text message or an email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Unless the invitee agrees to join the Service, we do not use the invitee’s contact information for marketing purposes, and we do not share such information with third parties. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our records at <a href="mailto:contact@gotogether.mobi" target="_top">contact@gotogether.mobi</a>
	.	<h4>Analytics information. </h4>
		We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
	.	<h4>Log file information: </h4>
		Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
	.	<h4>Device identifiers:</h4>
		When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by gotogether. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
	.	<h4>Location data:</h4>
		When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
	.	<h4>Commercial and marketing communications:</h4>
		We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
	.	Use of certain service type information we collect about you: We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalised content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising to your browser or device, and (h) automatically update the gotogether application on your mobile devices.
